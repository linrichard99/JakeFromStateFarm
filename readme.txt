Individual Electronic Helper
brought to you by JakeFromStateFarm

Description:
The Individual Electronic Helper, or IEH, is a Personal Device Assistant, or PDA, which stores reminders, contacts and memos (or rcm...but who actually says that). It can also tell time and notify you when there is an event on that day.

Getting Around:
On the main screen, type the words seen in the <angle brackets> to get to your destination. Typing Time will provide the current time. We recommend full screen for best experience.

In the apps, instructions are provided.

Scheduler:
You can create, delete, and access details for your events.
These events are sorted by date.

Contacts:
You can create, delete and access details about your friends and family (or enemies/acquiantances).
There is an email and a phone number slot.

Memos:
You can create, delete and access details about notes you may take.

Calendar:
You can go forward and back in months.
Today's date is shown on the bottom.
The asterisk means there is an event on that date.

To exit any app, or the main screen, type Exit.

Enjoy :)
